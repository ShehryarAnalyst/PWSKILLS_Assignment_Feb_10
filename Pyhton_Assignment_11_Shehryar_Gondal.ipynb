    "__Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ The __open()__ function is used to open a file in Python. It takes two arguments: the name of the file to open, and the mode in which to open it. There are several different modes of opening a file: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __\"r\"  mode__ (read-only): This is the default mode and allows you to read the contents of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __\"w\" mode__ (write-only): This mode allows you to write data to a file. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __\"a\" mode__ (append): This mode allows you to append new data to the end of a file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __\"x\" mode__ (exclusive creation): This mode allows you to create a new file, but raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __\"b\" mode__ (binary): This mode is used to open a file in binary mode, which is useful for reading and writing binary data like images, audio, and video files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __\"t\" mode__ (text): This mode is used to open a file in text mode, which is the default mode. In text mode, files are read and written as strings"

    "__Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ The __with statement__ is used with file operations to ensure that the file is properly closed after the block of code is executed. When a file is opened in Python, system resources are allocated to the file, and the with statement provides a cleaner syntax and ensures that the file is closed automatically. Using with and open() together eliminates the need to manually close the file, automatically closes the file when the block of code is exited, and provides a way to handle exceptions raised during file operations.<br>\n",
